### 题目

> 1085 Perfect Sequence （25）
> Given a sequence of positive integers and another positive integer `p`. The sequence is said to be a perfect sequence if `M≤m×p` where `M` and `m` are the maximum and minimum numbers in the sequence, respectively.
>
> Now given a sequence and a parameter `p`, you are supposed to find from the sequence as many numbers as possible to form a perfect subsequence.
>
> Input Specification:
> Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains two positive integers `N` and p, where N (≤10^5) is the number of integers in the sequence, and `p` (≤10^9) is the parameter. In the second line there are N positive integers, each is no greater than 10^9.
>
> Output Specification:
> For each test case, print in one line the maximum number of integers that can be chosen to form a perfect subsequence.
>
> Sample Input:
> 10 8
> 2 3 20 4 5 1 6 7 8 9
> Sample Output:
> 8

### 大意
输出满足`M≤m×p`的最多元素子集的长度

### 思路
1. 先对数组排序；
2. 利用two pointer，进行遍历；
3. 为保证重复数值下也能正常运行；
4. 考虑数量级，使用long long

### code
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char const *argv[]) {
  long long n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  long long wait[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) cin >> wait[i];
  sort(wait, wait + n);
  int left = 0, right = n - 1, maxlength = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    left = i;
    while (wait[right] <= wait[i] * m && right < n - 1) ++right;
    while (wait[right] > wait[i] * m && right > i) --right;
    if (right - left + 1 > maxlength) maxlength = right - left + 1;
  }
  cout << maxlength;
  return 0;
}
```
